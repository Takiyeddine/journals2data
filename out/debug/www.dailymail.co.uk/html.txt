        Boris Johnson (right) shared a 40-minute phone call with US President Joe Biden this evening in which the allied leaders agreed there is still hope for a diplomatic solution to the situation in Ukraine. It comes after Mr Johnson earlier today warned there could be less than 48 hours to stop an invasion. The PM is set to embark on another trip to Europe later this week as diplomatic efforts ramp up to defuse the standoff with Russia. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been in Kyiv today and will go to Moscow tomorrow. The UK, EU and US have set out brutal options for sanctions including starving Russia of foreign capital, holding up the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and targeting banks and oligarchs close to the Kremlin. But there is not yet a clear package agreed across Nato allies, with Germany among the countries seen as dragging their heels. Defence Secretary Ben Walllace revealed his frustration at the weekend by warning there was a 'whiff of Munich in the air' - a reference to the appeasement of Hitler. Mr Johnson took a thinly-veiled swipe today insisting that 'the world needs to learn the lesson of 2014' when not enough was done to move away from Russian gas and oil following the Russian activity in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.

      The banking giant has confirmed the sites, the majority of which are in England, will be closing, but are yet to provide a date as to when. The list of branches due to close includes the Royal Bank of Scotland branch inside NatWest's headquarters in Bishopsgate, central London. Most staff will be relocated to other branches, but the bank said 12 jobs will be put at risk. A statement from NatWest said: 'As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it's faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives.'

            Coleen Rooney (pictured centre and left) today lost the latest battle in her long-running Wagatha Christie war with Becky Vardy (pictured right with husband Jamie) after she was refused permission to add her rival's agent to the lawsuit. Ms Rooney's lawyers previously claimed that Mrs Vardy had leaked information to The Sun either directly or through her agent Caroline Watt 'acting on her instruction or with her knowing approval'. She asked for permission to bring an 'additional claim' against Ms Watt for misuse of private information and wanted it to be heard alongside the libel case. In a ruling on Monday, following a two-day hearing last week, Mrs Justice Steyn refused permission for the additional claim against Ms Watt. The two warring WAGs are now set for a legal showdown in May after the High Court judge ruled on key areas that could decide the case and insisted that it needed to be settled at a full trial as quickly as possible. The judge gave the go-ahead for Ms Rooney to amend her defence case to include an allegation that Ms Vardy, through Ms Watt, provided information to The Sun about an unnamed professional footballer. She also gave permission for disclosure of WhatsApp messages between Mrs Vardy and Ms Watt during the relevant period, and allowed Ms Rooney's application for an order that both parties make a joint request for information to Instagram. She refused other disclosure applications made by both Ms Rooney and Mrs Vardy.&nbsp;

            Jack Jeffery, 27,&nbsp;was injured while scoring a try for Evesham in their match against Berkswell and Balsall at their ground in Warwickshire on Saturday. He was taken to&nbsp;University Hospital Coventry but later died from his injuries. His family paid tribute to Jack, saying he 'enriched the lives of everyone who was lucky to know and have met him'. His sister Daisy said he 'never got back up' after scoring an 'amazing try' on Saturday afternoon, while his father Glenn said he died 'doing the thing that he loved the most, playing rugby'. Glenn told The Sun: 'When he failed to get up it was clear there was some sort of problem but the other players didn't seem to be worried, so I wasn't. They thought it was a head injury and he would come around... he was in and out of consciousness but at some point his heart stopped for 30 minutes. He lost a huge amount of blood and despite [doctors'] best efforts, they could not save him and he died in theatre.'

            The move will put U.S. diplomats far to the south of where Putin is amassing thousands of troops in Belarus and hundreds of miles from where the U.S. says Putin has stationed a force of well over 100,000 troops. Blinken attributed the move to the 'dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,' which continued over the weekend. 'I have no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans around the world, and that, of course, includes our colleagues serving at our posts overseas,' Blinken said in a statement announcing the move of personnel to about 50 miles from the Polish border.&nbsp;

            Sergei Lavrov and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's foreign and defence ministers, were both long-tabled during meetings with Putin on Monday as they discussed tensions on the border with Ukraine (top, Lavrov meets with the Russian president). it comes a week after Macron was given the same treatment after travelling to Moscow for talks aimed at avoiding war. During his meeting today, Lavrov urged Putin to allow more time for negotiations with Western powers - saying he is preparing to respond to American offers of arms control treaties and there is 'a chance' of getting results. Washington is warning that Putin could be just hours away from ordering an invasion of Ukraine, after massing 148,000 troops on the border while issuing a list of security demands that the West has largely dismissed.

            The General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) decided to remove Melissa Tweedie from the teaching register today following an investigation into her behaviour. Miss Tweedie, who is now 27, allegedly slept with the 18-year-old pupil after the leavers night at SWG3 in Glasgow in June 2017. The GTCS did not find this allegation proven on the weight of evidence presented to the panel but issued Miss Tweedie with a removal order after finding her conduct fell significantly short of the standard expected of a registered teacher.

            DAN WOOTTON: The inspirational Freedom Convoys that first won many millions of hearts in Canada are now spreading across the globe, despite the best efforts of Biden and Trudeau to demonise them as 'swastika-waving' far-right extremists. We're not buying the bulls*** from these international leaders who try to convince us it is these folk - many of whom have lost their jobs because they believe in bodily autonomy - who are the ones trying to divide us. While swathes of the mainstream media, taking cues from their revered prime ministers and presidents, may try and dismiss the various Freedom Convoys as the domain of racist and violent conspiracy theorists, that's not what we're seeing with our own eyes on the various live streams provided by the honest folk on the ground.

            Loraine Martins (left), the UK's top-paid public sector diversity chief at Network Rail, earns up to £164,999 a year and previously shared an article (inset) accusing Boris Johnson (right) of 'white privilege'. Data released by the government shows Martins is paid a minimum of £160,000 which can rise to a maximum of £164,999, meaning she could earn more than the Prime Minister whose yearly earning is capped at almost £162,000. In 2018, she used her Twitter account to share a comment piece from the Guardian which accused Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, of 'white privilege'. And in April 2021, she retweeted a post from television presenter Adil Ray who accused the government of 'corruption', according to the publication Guido Fawkes , although the retweet has since been removed. According to the Women at Work online summit, Martins' role includes overseeing 'a centre of expertise which supports Network Rail's ambition to be a more open, diverse and inclusive business'.

            A senior RAF officer (middle inset) suspended after neighbours (left) told police they had seen him moon them naked in his garden (right) told investigators he only bent over to 'pick up a tennis ball for his dogs'. Air Marshal Andrew Turner, 54, sent a letter to the family last week apologising for an incident he said caused 'absolutely unintentional upset'. Neighbour Simon Herbert, also 54, had alerted police after spotting Air Marshall Turner&nbsp;nude in the paddock of his £1.5million thatched cottage. When the RAF man allegedly 'bared his backside' at him he went to confront him at the home in Cane End, Oxfordshire, and then complained to Thames Valley Police, triggering an investigation. Officers who attended the report of the 'public order incident' consulted with the CPS and Air Marshall Turner was handed a&nbsp;community resolution order last week. Sources said the military man had insisted he had been unclothed because the weather was 'hot'. And he is said to have only bent over to pick up a tennis ball for one of his two dogs.

Mr Hancock has been grilled by&nbsp;entrepreneur Steven Bartlett for an episode of his 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast. Mr Bartlett, who appears on the Dragon's Den TV show as an investor, said on Twitter that Mr Hancock and Ms&nbsp;Coladangelo had 'stopped by' for a tell-all chat. The host said the interview was 'a little heated' but Mr Hancock 'did answer all of the tough questions I asked him and nothing will be edited out'.

            Buckingham Palace again refused to say today whether the Queen had Covid-19, hours after Camilla tested positive four days after her husband Prince Charles. Royal sources said Camilla, 74, has been triple vaccinated, adding that Clarence House will continue to follow government guidelines and review her engagements. Camilla and Charles, 73, are both now self-isolating, but Buckingham Palace officials said they would 'not be providing a running commentary' on the Queen's health. Royal officials confirmed last week that the Queen had no symptoms, and told MailOnline today that they had 'nothing to add' to this after Camilla's positive test. Camilla has caught the virus for the first time but Charles contracted it for a second time. She carried out engagements last Thursday - the day Charles tested positive. A Clarence House spokesman said: 'The Duchess of Cornwall has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating. We continue to follow government guidelines.' It comes as doctors continue to monitor the Queen's health after Charles was diagnosed with Covid-19 less than 48 hours after seeing his mother last week. Camilla described herself as 'luckily' negative the same day, saying of her testing regime during a visit to Buckinghamshire (pictured) last Thursday: 'I've taken it so many times'. Also pictured: Charles and Camilla at a British Asian Trust reception at the British Museum last Wednesday, the day before Charles tested positive.

       The 66-year-old host missed just eight episodes after ABC announced it was benching the comedian for two weeks - presumably ten episodes - following her last broadcast on January 31, where she apologized for saying the Holocaust was 'not about race' on the previous day's show. But on Monday, Goldberg was back on the air after missing just eight shows. ABC did not immediately return a comment regarding her early return as of Monday afternoon. 'Well, hello, hello, hello and welcome to The View. And yes, I am back… And I missed you all, too,' Goldberg said to viewers and her co-hosts at the top of the show. 'I've got to tell you, there's something kind of marvelous about being on a show like this, because we are The View and this is what we do. And sometimes we don't do it as delicately as we could.' 'But it's five minutes to get in important information about topics. And that's what we try to do every day. And I want to thank everybody who reached out while I was away,' she continued.

            Prince Harry watched last night's dramatic Super Bowl in Los Angeles with his cousin Princess Eugenie alongside a host of Hollywood stars including Kendall Jenner, Jay-Z and Justin Bieber. The 37-year-old sat in the stands with his cousin at the SoFi Stadium to see the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in a fourth-quarter comeback at Super Bowl LVI - but there was no sign of Meghan. Harry and Eugenie, 31, sat in luxurious leather seats inside a private box at the stadium and wore face coverings in accordance with Los Angeles County rules which require KN95 or N95-grade masks for large outdoor events. The presence of the two royals at the star-studded event - which also hosted the likes of Ryan Reynolds, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Charlize Theron, Rebel Wilson, Ellen DeGeneres and more - was announced by the NFL, whose UK Twitter account shared a photo of them and wrote: 'Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie in the house at #SBLVI.' Also pictured at last night's game: Emily Ratajkowski (top left), Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez (bottom left), and Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner (bottom right).

            Princess Eugenie has become the first member of the Royal Family to make a public visit to Prince Harry in California two years after he quit as a senior royal, as they were seen attending last night's Super Bowl alongside a host of Hollywood stars including Kendall Jenner, Jay-Z and Justin Bieber - but there was no sign of Meghan. The cousins sat in the premium seats at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles as concern mounts back in Britain over the Duke of Sussex's forthcoming tell-all biography overshadowing his grandmother the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Some Twitter users initially mistook Eugenie for Meghan, but the Duchess was not there. The couple, who wed in 2018 and live nearby in a $14million Montecito mansion, are parents to Archie, two, and eight month-old Lilibet - so it is likely that Meghan was at home looking after the children while her husband went to the showpiece game. Meghan is also close to Eugenie having been introduced to her before she had even met Harry, through their mutual friend Misha Nonoo. It therefore seems possible that Eugenie could be staying with the Sussexes in the US. Harry, 37, and Eugenie, 31, have been friends since childhood despite their six-year age gap and are known to still get on well despite the Duke's removal from royal public life in Britain and his repeated attacks on his wider family. And Eugenie's visit will be viewed by some observers as a potential effort to rebuild broken bridges between Harry and the rest of the family - with an important series of royal occasions coming up over the next few months. Also pictured: Harry and Eugenie together in 2012 (top right) and 2007 (bottom right) in London.

            Teenage Russian ice skater Kamila Valieva has been cleared to continue to compete at the Beijing Winter Olympics despite testing positive for a banned drug. The 15-year-old landed the first ever quadruple jump by a woman at the Winter Olympics, to win gold for the Russian team last week. But the following day the medal ceremony was put on hold when results from a test on December 25 last year found she had taken the banned substance, trimetazidine, that can enhance performance. However she has today been told it would be unfair to suspend her from the Olympics by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after a near six hour grilling in Beijing by video. The CAS panel ruled that a suspension could cause her 'irreparable harm' and said the youngster can continue to perform due to the 'exceptional circumstances' of her case. It added that Valieva was 'protected person' under the World Anti-Doping Code. Valieva (pictured taking tumble in training today) is now free to take part in the women's individual figure skating competition on Tuesday, in which she is favourite for gold.

            The Miami-based Black Tape Project - known for its daring styles and for bringing&nbsp;new meaning to the phrase 'less is more' - showcased one of its most revealing collections. Bikinis made entirely out of tape were on display during the show, held on Sunday at The Ziegfeld Ballroom during the week-long event, which started on February 11 this year and will run until February 16. 'King of Tape' Joel Alvarez founded fashion brand Black Tape Project back in 2008 and usually uses a spectrum of different tapes - including mirrored and metallics - to create his daring designs.

            The legendary drummer (pictured left and, recently, inset) , now aged 81, compiled the rarely-seen images of himself with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison as part of an uplifting project. He sourced and researched the photos, many of which were taken by fans, and secured permission to publish them. The behind-the-scenes images chart the very beginning of the Fab Four, through to the height of Beatlemania, touring America and then the tensions that culminated in the world's biggest band splitting up. They have been put together in the book 'Lifted: Fab Images and Memories in My Life With The Beatles From Across the Universe' that is due to be released today. A limited number of 1,000 have been signed by Sir Ringo and cost £365 ($495) each. Also pictured: George Harrison, Sir Paul McCartney, John Lennon and&nbsp; Sir Ringo in Washington DC (top right) at the height of their success as the Beatles in the 1960s; Sir Paul, Harrison, Lennon and Sir Ringo are seen during their Magical Mystery Tour (bottom right).

            Boris Johnson and Kim Jong-un - two men with instantly recognisable haridos, a love of the finer things in life and a history of womanizing who also share a love of a good photo op. That has led to some strikingly similar photos of the two men emerging over the years, as this MailOnline compilation shows. Supreme Leader Johns-un can be seen offering field guidance to shipyard workers (top left), at a food factory (second left), on horseback (second right) and sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet (top right) whilst Kim can be seen doing... almost the exact same things as part of North Korean propaganda.

       More than four years after Amazon secured the rights to The Lord of the Rings franchise, the first footage has been released from The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. A teaser for the new series aired during Sunday night's Super Bowl LV1, with fans given their first glimpse at the franchise's diverse new direction, which features the first ever black elf in Middle Earth's history.&nbsp; Amazon shelled out $250 million just for the TV rights to the Lord of the Rings franchise alone, with a five-season production commitment said to be worth at least $1 billion and making it the most expensive series in TV history.

       Casey Waller, of Tupelo, Mississippi, had tucked in her two-year-old son Jase for the night but when she checked the baby monitor she discovered it had moved. The 30-year-old looked through the monitor footage and discovered that her crafty toddler had knocked it over. The video shows Jase bouncing in his crib before spotting the monitor's light and hurling a ball at it, getting a perfect hit on his first attempt.

            The eight-tap spray whirlpool bath (left) was ordered by millionaire Edward Portman (right) in the 1890s - possibly as a Valentine's Day present - at the grand Hestercombe House (inset) as a gift for his wife Constance (circled right). It boasts settings including 'wave', 'plunge', 'spray' and 'douche', and although it has not been used for years, is still in full working order - making it among the best-preserved in the UK. It cost Portman around £45 - the equivalent of £5,000 in today's money - to have the bath fitted. It was designed and installed by George Jennings Ltd, the firm founded by the engineer of the same name who invented the first public flush toilets. The bath is now set to be shown off as part of an exhibition of the Hestercombe estate, which is set across more than 100 acres near Taunton.

The hits include classic love songs by Elvis and Frankie Vallie, as well as more modern offerings by Beyonce and Bruno Mars. The current record to beat is one minute - so, how quickly can you name all 15 songs?

       Natasha Magnan, who runs the&nbsp;White Swan Inn in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, shared the pub's CCTV footage, which showed the pint fall off a table on Sunday night at around 7.30pm. Ms Magnan has worked at the pub for the last 20 years and said there have been several 'unusual sightings of ghosts' by staff and customers. The 37-year-old said she felt like someone was 'watching' her when she went down to the cellar last week and other staff had reported seeing strange figures in the building. The CCTV footage shows the glass standing on a table as customers sit chatting nearby before it suddenly topples over, despite none of the drinkers touching it.

            Eight-year-old Persian cat Moet, (pictured) who lives in Nottingham with owner Emily Shotter, 51, lost her eyes after living on the streets of Oman has found worldwide TikTok fame. She had her eyeballs removed as a kitten after living on the streets without food, water and a safe place to sleep, which led to the deterioration of her vision. She was found in a dirty cage and just a litter box to lie on. She was rescued by a local charity before being adopted just weeks after, by Emily Shotter, 51, from Nottingham, in 2015, who had only popped in to get food supplies for her other cat.

The influencer, who has over 2 million Instagram followers, told the YouTube show, Hooked on the Look, that it had been years since she'd been loved up and attributed her unlucky love streak to men finding her intimidating. Natasha said: 'My last relationship was seven years ago. I am pretty extreme, so I think people are afraid of me.' Pictured: on This Morning and showing off her backside

       Katri Lylynpera (inset), 28, shared videos of the Finland team hotel in Beijing being flooded last Wednesday. The footage shows entire corridors being drenched in water after pouring through the light fixtures (left) in yet another embarrassing moment for the much-maligned event. Floods of water came out the front doors of the hotel, with desperate staff seen trying to dampen the stairs outside with hand towels and salt (right).

       Police were called to the scene&nbsp;at around 8.30am on February 7 after local residents reported hundreds of dead birds&nbsp;strewn across the sidewalk&nbsp;in the Alvaro Obregon area of Cuauhtemoc, a city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Shocking footage, which has gone viral on social media, shows the flock suddenly drop to the ground. Some of the birds recovered and were seen flying away but dozens remained dead on the street. Separate footage shows the yellow-headed blackbirds being swept into piles. A veterinarian who examined the dead birds suggested they could have died as a result of inhaling toxic fumes, perhaps from a heater, or electrocution after perching on power lines.

       Seven-month-old Otto was being filmed by his father Ben Millner as he looked out of a large window at the&nbsp;£490-a-night Cheetah Safari Lodge at West Midlands Safari Park in Bewdley,&nbsp;Worcestershire. The baby appeared to spot something in the pitch blackness outside moments before the cheetah suddenly pounced, hitting the reinforced glass with a thud. Otto appeared unfazed and fearlessly continued watching the big cat as it turned round to face him in the footage, filmed on January 29.

Others (pictured) show them turning their backs to the camera while on the pitch at Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester.

            Firefighters used a ladder to bring the woman down to ground level in Woodlands Edge, Trowbridge, on Saturday morning. Leanne Jones, 32, was eating her lunch with her baby macaw Missy on Friday afternoon when she flew away into a tree. She stayed outside with her all night waiting for her to come down by herself, but the next morning the branch snapped and Missy flapped towards another tree. Leanne's sister Toni-Anne, 33, tried to scale the tree in Woodlands Edge, Trowbridge herself to reach the bird, but got stuck.

            A theme park based on the anime films of Studio Ghibli, renowned for titles including the Oscar-winning Spirited Away, will open in Japan's central Aichi region on November 1. The studio has also unveiled a series of renderings that offer a glimpse at what the park will look like. 'Ghibli Park' will be divided up into five areas - three of which will open in November. In the main image, a rendering shows the 'Hill of Youth' section, where visitors will find the 'World Emporium' - the antique shop that features in the 1995 film Whisper of the Heart. The inset picture shows Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki. Pictured top left is the park's life-size model of the house where the main characters of the 1988 classic My Neighbor Totoro lived, and bottom left is a rendering of The Valley of Witches area in the park, which will be inspired by the films Kiki's Delivery Service and Howl's Moving Castle.

            Three-year-old Pavlova, a former stray, was taken in by the RSPCA's Middlesex North West and South Hertfordshire branch in January. A family had been feeding her and had even made her a wooden box shelter to sleep in over Christmas - but handed her in when they became concerned for her welfare at the end of last month. Charity workers now say the mustachioed moggy would be best suited to a 'quiet,&nbsp;adult-only home without other pets', ideally with some outside space for her to explore. They are hoping Pavlova's striking 'moustache' - which appears similar in style to the goatee sported by Bolshevik politician&nbsp;Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known as 'Lenin' -&nbsp;will help give her an edge in landing a forever home. The resemblance to the former Soviet leader is not simply one of appearance either, as she is known to be quite 'nervous' and will 'hiss' at charity workers - perhaps comparable to Lenin, who was known for his fiery temper and who suffered a number of strokes, possibly due to the pressure of reforming Tsarist Russia into a socialist paradise.
