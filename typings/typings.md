# Typings

> NB: This is a directory used by Pylance (MyPy) VSCode extension to add strong typing features to external libraries.

Edit `ms-python.vscode-pylance|` > Workspace > `python.analysis.stubPath` and select the path of the `typings` directory.

Ex: For the `python` working directory, I set up `./journals2data/typings` for this parameter.
