Novavax\u2019s adjuvant is derived from the bark of an evergreen tree native to Chile.\n\nThis approach of combining a protein with an adjuvant is similar to that of vaccines against other diseases, including GlaxoSmithKline GSK -0.15% PLC\u2019s shingles vaccine, Shingrix.\n\nIt is a different mechanism from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, which use gene-based technologies, and those from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, AZN -0.10% which use viral-vector technology.\n\nHow Novavax's Vaccine Works\n\nTraditional vaccines use the actual virus to generate an immune response. Novavax's relies on a synthesized version of the coronavirus's outer spike proteins, which are what antibodies use to recognize the virus. Scientists make the protein by genetically modifying an unrelated insect virus, a baculovirus, and then using that modified virus to infect cells cloned from the armyworm insect. Coronavirus spike protein Baculovirus Modified virus The vaccine is made from a stabilized form of the coronavirus spike protein, which is anchored in a lipid nanoparticle and then injected into the body. The purified protein antigens in the vaccine can't replicate and can't cause Covid-19. The vaccine also contains a compound that enhances desired immune system responses to the vaccine.

Federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health provided funding for the trial.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the study volunteers received the vaccine in two doses, three weeks apart, while one-third received a placebo.\n\nResearchers kept track of how many people in each group contracted Covid-19 with symptoms, starting seven days after their second injection.\n\nThe company reported results in a press release, and the data haven\u2019t been vetted by outside experts. Novavax said it plans to submit the results to a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nResearchers identified 77 cases of mild to severe Covid-19 among all study subjects between January and April. Of these, 14 were among those who had received the vaccine, and 63 among those who had gotten a placebo.\n\nNovavax said all cases of Covid-19 among vaccinated people in the study were mild, and none met the criteria for moderate and severe, including deaths and hospitalizations.\n\nBy comparison, among the 63 cases in the placebo group, 10 were moderate and four were severe, findings that led Novavax to conclude that the vaccine was 100% effective against moderate and severe Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe data are terrific,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, professor of vaccinology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \u201cThis is great news for the world, given the desperate need for more vaccines. It also provides another option in the U.S. if boosters are needed, and for children, as those trials are in progress.\u201d\n\nThe trial coincided with the spread in the U.S. of the Alpha variant of the coronavirus, first identified in the U.K. The highly transmissible strain became the predominant strain circulating in the U.S.\n\nNovavax sequenced the viruses found in 54 of the 77 cases of symptomatic Covid-19. Of these sequenced cases, 65% were the Alpha strain or other variants of concern, the company said.\n\nResearchers label a strain as a variant of concern if there is evidence it is more contagious, produces more severe disease or is better able to evade drugs or vaccines.\n\nAnother 17% of the sequenced cases were variants of interest, strains that are generally less prevalent than the variants of concern but which public-health authorities are monitoring.\n\nNovavax said that the vaccine was 93.2% effective combined against the variants of concern and variants of interest in the study.\n\nThere were only a handful of Covid-19 cases among study subjects caused by certain other variants including those that were first identified in Brazil and India, named gamma and delta, respectively.\n\nBecause the numbers were so small, Novavax wasn\u2019t able to conclude how its vaccine performed against those variants.\n\nThe most common side effects after vaccination, Novavax said, were injection-site pain and tenderness, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. The rates of those side effects were generally higher after the second dose.\n\nNovavax said the injection site reactions generally lasted less than three days and the other symptoms less than two days. The rate of serious and severe adverse events were low and balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups, the company said.\n\nOne challenge conducting the study, Novavax said, was the availability of authorized vaccines. Study subjects, particularly older adults, who received a placebo began to drop out to get one of the authorized vaccines.\n\nTo stem the tide of dropouts, Novavax in April began to provide its vaccine to those who had received a placebo in the study.\n\nIn all, about 5,000 people dropped out of the study, Novavax said, meaning the Covid-19 cases that were used to determine efficacy occurred among the remaining 25,000 study subjects, Dr. Glenn said.\n\nCovid-19 Vaccines Related coverage, selected by the editors\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com",

Press secretary Jen Psaki said there would be 'consequences' for Moscow if Navalny dies. (April 19) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin said he could not guarantee opposition leader Alexei Navalny would leave prison alive and denied ordering an assassination attempt on the anti-corruption crusader.\n\nPutin's remarks, made in an interview with NBC News that aired in part on Monday, mark a fresh provocation from the Russian autocrat as he prepares to sit down with U.S. President Joe Biden for a high-stakes summit this week.\n\nThe two leaders will meet June 16 in Geneva, amid escalating tensions over the Kremlin's cyberattacks and election interference in the U.S. and Putin's efforts to stifle dissent inside Russia.\n\nRead more: From Reagan and Gorbachev to Biden and Putin: 6 meetings show how the US-Russia relationship has evolved\n\nNavalny, an activist and one of Putin's fiercest critics, returned to Russia from Germany in January after recovering from poisoning with a nerve agent. He was detained shortly after his arrival in Moscow and sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for violating the terms of his probation while he was treated abroad.\n\nNavalny initially went on a hunger strike, and his allies say he came close to death before ending his strike on the advice of doctors.\n\nAsked if he could guarantee Navanly would leave prison alive, Putin claimed he had no say over the matter.\n\n'Look, such decisions in this country are not made by the president,' Putin said.\n\nPressed on Navalny's status, Putin said, 'He will not be treated any worse than anybody else.'\n\nBiden said on Monday that it would be a 'tragedy' if Navalny died in jail. 'It would do nothing but hurt his relationships with the rest of the world, in my view, and with me,' he said during a news conference in Brussels after meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nNavalny's case is likely to be one of many flashpoints between Biden and Putin during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined with 'high confidence' that Russia's Federal Security Service used the nerve agent Novichok to poison Navalny last August. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Russia in the wake of that finding.\n\nPutin has denied any involvement in the attack on Navalny, a position he repeated to NBC.\n\n'We don't have this kind of habit of assassinating anybody,' Putin said when pressed on Navalny's poisoning.\n\nThe Russian leader also flatly denied that Moscow was behind the recent SolarWinds cyberattack or that the Kremlin interfered in the 2020 presidential election. The Biden administration has sanctioned Russia over both of those matters.\n\n'We have been accused of all kinds of things,' Putin told NBC. 'Election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth. And not once, not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof. Just unfounded accusations.'\n\nMore: Biden will confront Vladimir Putin about ransomware as cyberattacks increase in US\n\nBiden-Putin summit: How the meeting will impact US-Russia relations Biden is expected to give Putin a laundry list of grievances. Here are three topics the two leaders will likely discuss at the Geneva summit. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nPutin said the U.S.-Russia relationship has 'deteriorated to what is the lowest point in recent years,' but said he and Biden would be able to work together on issues of 'mutual interest,' such as arms control.\n\nHe shrugged off questions about Biden's affirmative answer, during an interview earlier this year, when he was asked if Putin was a 'killer.'\n\nBiden did not back away from that characterization during Monday's news conference. 'When I was asked that question on air, I answered it honestly, Biden said. 'I don't think it matters a whole lot in terms of this next meeting we're about to have.'\n\nA look ahead: With US-Russia relations at low point, Biden, Putin each bring a wariness to Geneva summit\n\nPutin said he works with people he disagrees with all the time. 'People with whom I work ... we argue,' the Russia leader said. 'We are not bride and groom. We don't swear everlasting love and friendship.'\n\nHe did, however, offer warm words for former President Donald Trump, who tried to cultivate close ties with Putin even as his advisers pressed for a tough approach to Russia.\n\n'Mr. Trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual.

He was detained shortly after his arrival in Moscow and sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for violating the terms of his probation while he was treated abroad.\n\n        Navalny initially went on a hunger strike, and his allies say he came close to death before ending his strike on the advice of doctors.\n\n        Asked if he could guarantee Navanly would leave prison alive, Putin claimed he had no say over the matter.\n\n        'Look, such decisions in this country are not made by the president,' Putin said.\n\n        Pressed on Navalny's status, Putin said, 'He will not be treated any worse than anybody else.'\n\n        Biden said on Monday that it would be a 'tragedy' if Navalny died in jail. 'It would do nothing but hurt his relationships with the rest of the world, in my view, and with me,' he said during a news conference in Brussels after meeting with NATO leaders. \n\n        Navalny's case is likely to be one of many flashpoints between Biden and Putin during Wednesday's meeting.   \n\n        The U.S. intelligence community has determined with 'high confidence' that Russia's Federal Security Service used the nerve agent Novichok to poison Navalny last August. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Russia in the wake of that finding. \n\n        Putin has denied any involvement in the attack on Navalny, a position he repeated to NBC. \n\n        'We don't have this kind of habit of assassinating anybody,' Putin said when pressed on Navalny's poisoning. \n\n        The Russian leader also flatly denied that Moscow was behind the recent SolarWinds cyberattack or that the Kremlin interfered in the 2020 presidential election. The Biden administration has sanctioned Russia over both of those matters. \n\n        'We have been accused of all kinds of things,' Putin told NBC. 'Election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth. And not once, not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof. Just unfounded accusations.\n\n        Tensions are high between US and Russia. Here's what to expect when Biden meets Putin.\n\n        Biden is expected to give Putin a laundry list of grievances. Here are three topics the two leaders will likely discuss at the Geneva summit.\n\n        Putin said the U.S.-Russia relationship has 'deteriorated to what is the lowest point in recent years,' but said he and Biden would be able to work together on issues of 'mutual interest,' such as arms control. \n\n        He shrugged off questions about Biden's affirmative answer, during an interview earlier this year, when he was asked if Putin was a 'killer.' \n\n        Biden did not back away from that characterization during Monday's news conference. 'When I was asked that question on air, I answered it honestly, Biden said. 'I don't think it matters a whole lot in terms of this next meeting we're about to have.' \n\n        A look ahead: With US-Russia relations at low point, Biden, Putin each bring a wariness to Geneva summit\n\n        Putin said he works with people he disagrees with all the time. 'People with whom I work ... we argue,' the Russia leader said. 'We are not bride and groom. We don't swear everlasting love and friendship.'\n\n        He did, however, offer warm words for former President Donald Trump, who tried to cultivate close ties with Putin even as his advisers pressed for a tough approach to Russia. \n\n        'Mr. Trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual. Otherwise he would not have become U.S. president,' Putin said.\n        ",

            "n3k": "(CNN) The US government has spent the past week assessing a report of a leak at a Chinese nuclear power plant, after a French company that part owns and helps operate it warned of an 'imminent radiological threat,' according to US officials and documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe warning included an accusation that the Chinese safety authority was raising the acceptable limits for radiation detection outside the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong province in order to avoid having to shut it down, according to a letter from the French company to the US Department of Energy obtained by CNN.\n\nDespite the alarming notification from Framatome, the French company, the Biden administration believes the facility is not yet at a 'crisis level,' one of the sources said.\n\nWhile US officials have deemed the situation does not currently pose a severe safety threat to workers at the plant or Chinese public, it is unusual that a foreign company would unilaterally reach out to the American government for help when its Chinese state-owned partner is yet to acknowledge a problem exists. The scenario could put the US in a complicated situation should the leak continue or become more severe without being fixed.\n\nHowever, concern was significant enough that the National Security Council held multiple meetings last week as they monitored the situation, including two at the deputy level and another gathering at the assistant secretary level on Friday, which was led by NSC Senior Director for China Laura Rosenberger and Senior Director for Arms Control Mallory Stewart, according to US officials.\n\nThe Biden administration has discussed the situation with the French government and their own experts at the Department of Energy, sources said. The US has also been in contact with the Chinese government, US officials said, though the extent of that contact is unclear.\n\nThe US government declined to explain the assessment but officials at the NSC, State Department and the Department of Energy insisted that if there were any risk to the Chinese public, the US would be required to make it known under current treaties related to nuclear accidents.\n\nFramatome had reached out to the US in order to obtain a waiver that would allow them to share American technical assistance in order to resolve the issue at the Chinese plant. There are only two reasons why this waiver would be granted, and one is an 'imminent radiological threat,' the same verbiage used in the June 8 memo.\n\nThe memo claims the Chinese limit was increased to exceed French standards, yet it remains unclear how that compares to US limits.\n\n'It is not surprising that the French would reach out,' according to Cheryl Rofer, a nuclear scientist who retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2001. 'In general, this sort of thing is not extraordinary, particularly if they think the country they are contacting has some special ability to help.'\n\n'But China likes to project that everything is just fine, all the time,' she added.\n\nThe US could give permission for Framatome to provide the technical assistance or support to help resolve the issue, but it is the Chinese government's decision whether the incident requires shutting down the plant completely, the documents obtained by CNN indicate.\n\nUltimately, the June 8 request for assistance from Framatome is the only reason why the US became involved in the situation at all, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nHowever, the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant published a statement on its website Sunday night local time, maintaining that environmental readings for both the plant and its surrounding area were 'normal.'\n\nThe two nuclear reactors in Taishan are both operational, the statement said, adding that Unit 2 had recently completed an 'overhaul' and 'successfully connected to the grid on June 10, 2021.' The statement did not define why or how the plant was overhauled.\n\n'Since it was put into commercial operation, the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant has strictly controlled the operation of the units in accordance with operating license documents and technical procedures. All operating indicators of the two units have met the requirements of nuclear safety regulations and power plant technical specifications,' the statement noted.\n\nIn a separate statement Friday, hours after CNN first reached out for comment, Framatome acknowledged the company 'is supporting resolution of a performance issue with the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province, China.'\n\n'According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters. Our team is working with relevant experts to assess the situation and propose solutions to address any potential issue,' the statement added.\n\nFramatome would not directly address the content of the letter to the Department of Energy when asked by CNN.\n\nThe letter comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington remain high and as G7 leaders met this weekend in the United Kingdom with China an important topic of discussion. There are no indications the reports of a leak were discussed at a high level at the summit.\n\nFrench utility company Electrictie de France (EDF) said in a statement it has been informed of an increase concentration of 'noble gases in the primary circuit' of reactor number one of the Taishan nuclear power plant.\n\nEDF holds a 30% stake in the company with Chinese state energy company China General Nuclear Power Group in TNPJVC, which owns and operates the power plant in southern China.\n\nEDF says 'the presence of certain noble gases in the primary circuit is a known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures,' but did not elaborate on gas levels.\n\nLater on Monday, a spokesperson for EDF said the increased levels of radiation were caused by a 'degradation of the housing of the fuel rods.'\n\nThe spokesperson affirmed that the levels of radioactivity observed at the plant were below the threshold stipulated by the Chinese authorities, adding that the affected housings are the first of three containment barriers between the rods and the atmosphere.\n\nThe spokesperson noted that the risk of a potential leakage in the rod housing was first discussed following a planned refueling outage in October 2020 after initial measurements led to suspicions of a 'lack of tightness' in the housings.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson stressed that without a full analysis, it is too early to confirm whether a complete shutdown of the reactor is needed, adding that EDF currently has no information regarding the origin of the rod housing degradation.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Chinese authorities in Beijing and Guangdong province, where the plant is located, and the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC. None have responded directly, though China is amidst a three-day national holiday that runs through the end of Monday.\n\nA warning from a French nuclear company\n\nThe issue first emerged when Framatome, a French designer and supplier of nuclear equipment and services that was contracted to help construct and operate the Chinese-French plant, reached out to the US Department of Energy late last month informing them of a potential issue at the Chinese nuclear plant.\n\nThe company, mainly owned by EDF, the French utility company, then submitted an operational safety assistance request on June 3, formally asking for a waiver that would allow them to address an urgent safety matter, to the Department of Energy, warning American officials that the nuclear reactor is leaking fission gas.\n\nThe company followed up with DOE on June 8 asking for an expedited review of their request, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\n\n'The situation is an imminent radiological threat to the site and to the public and Framatome urgently requests permission to transfer technical data and assistance as may be necessary to return the plant to normal operation,' read the June 8 memo from the company's subject matter expert to the Energy Department.\n\nFramatome reached out to the US government for assistance, the document indicates, because a Chinese government agency was continuing to increase its limits on the amount of gas that could safely be released from the facility without shutting it down, according to the documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for comment, the Energy Department did not directly address the memo's claim that China was raising the limits.\n\nIn the June 8 memo, Framatome informed DOE the Chinese safety authority has continued to raise regulatory 'off-site dose limits.' It also says the company suspects that limit might be increased again as to keep the leaking reactor running despite safety concerns for the surrounding population.\n\n'To ensure off-site dose limits are maintained within acceptable bounds to not cause undue harm to the surrounding population, TNPJVC (operator of Taishan-1) is required to comply with an regulatory limit and otherwise shut the reactor down if such a limit is exceeded,' the June 8 memo reads.\n\nIt notes that this limit was established at a level consistent with what is dictated by the French safety authority, but 'due to the increasing number of failures,' China's safety authority, the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) has since revised the limit to more than double the initial release, 'which in turn increases off-site risk to the public and on-site workers.'\n\nAs of May 30, the Taishan reactor had reached 90% of the allegedly revised limit, the memo adds, noting concerns the plant operator may be 'petitioning the NNSA to further increase the shutdown limit on an exigent basis in an effort to keep running which in turn would continue to increase the risk to the off-site population and the workers at the plant site.'\n\nThe NNSA is China's nuclear safety regulatory authority. It oversees the implementation of safety standards at facilities like Taishan.\n\nThe US State Department came into possession of the June 8 letter and immediately began engaging with interagency partners and with the French government, State Department officials said.\n\nOver the course of 48-72 hours, the US government has been in repeated contact with French officials and US technical experts at DOE, State Department officials said, noting that this flurry of activity was due to the June 8 letter.\n\nSubsequently, there were several urgent questions for the French government and Framatome, they added. CNN has reached out to the French embassy in Washington for comment.\n\nStill, Rofer, the retired nuclear scientist, warns that a gas leak could indicate bigger problems.\n\n'If they do have a gas leak, that indicates some of their containment is broken,' Rofer said. 'It also argues that maybe some of the fuel elements could be broken, which would be a more serious problem.'\n\n'That would be a reason for shutting down the reactor and would then require the reactor to be refueled,' Rofer told CNN, adding that removing the fuel elements must be done carefully.\n\nFor now, US officials do not think the leak is at 'crisis level,' but acknowledge it is increasing and bears monitoring, the source familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nWhile there is a chance the situation could become a disaster, US officials currently believe it is more likely that it will not become one, the source added.\n\nChina has expanded its use of nuclear energy in recent years, and it represents about 5% of all power generated in the country. According to China Nuclear Energy Association, there were 16 operational nuclear plants with 49 nuclear reactors in China as of March 2021, with the total generation capacity of 51,000 megawatts.\n\nThe Taishan plant is a prestige project built after China signed a nuclear electricity generation agreement with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, which is mainly owned by the French government. The construction of the plant started in 2009, and the two units started generating electricity in 2018 and 2019, respectively\n\nThe city of Taishan has a population of 950,000 and is situated in the southeast of the country in Guangdong province, which is home to 126 million residents and has a GDP of $1.6 trillion, comparable to that of Russia and South Korea.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA).

He later said the electric car maker would not accept bitcoin due to concerns over how mining the currency requires high energy use and contributes to climate change.\n\n        'When there's confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,' Musk said on Twitter on Sunday.\n\n        Bitcoin BTC=BTSPrallied more than 9% after that message, breaking above its 20-day moving average, and climbed further in Asia to hit $39,838.92.\n\n        'Musk's words caused bitcoin to surge,' said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro.\n\n        It was last up 0.5% at $39,189, straining to escape the relatively tight trading range of this month.\n\n        The market was also supported by software company and major bitcoin-backer MicroStrategy MSTR.O raising half a billion dollars to buy bitcoin, said Bobby Ong, co-founder of crypto analytics website CoinGecko.\n\n        Bitcoin is up about a third this year but has collapsed from a record peak above $60,000 amid a regulatory crackdown in China and Musk's apparently wavering enthusiasm for it. Telsa TSLA.O stock is down about 30% since the company's bitcoin purchase.\n\n        Musk's tweet was made in response to an article based on remarks from Magda Wierzycka, head of cybersecurity firm Syngia SYGJ.J, who in a radio interview last week accused him of 'price manipulation' and selling a 'big part' of his exposure.\n\n        'This is inaccurate,' Musk said. 'Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.'\n\n        Musk had tweeted in May that Tesla 'will not be selling any bitcoin' and 'has not sold any bitcoin,' but investors are keenly awaiting Tesla's next earnings update - due next month - for any disclosure of changes to its position.\n\n        Musk has taken issue with the vast computing power required to process bitcoin transactions and in early June posted messages appearing to lament a breakup with bitcoin.\n\n        (Reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore and Tom Wilson in London; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Chizu Nomiyama)\n\n        The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n        ",

            "manual": "\n        Stocks narrowly eked out fresh record levels as traders awaited a key monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve. \n\n        The S&P 500 pushed into positive territory in the final minutes of trading, logging a fresh record close. The Dow ended lower, while the Nasdaq gained and set its own record closing level. Treasury yields advanced, and the benchmark 10-year yield hovered just below 1.5%. \n\n        U.S. stocks are hovering at record levels, powered to fresh highs by a combination of rebounding economic activity and corporate profits, and a bevy of ongoing support from both fiscal and monetary policymakers. The duration of this monetary policy support will come into focus this week with the Federal Reserve's policy decision and press conference on Wednesday. With the economy improving from its pandemic-era lows and prices jumping as demand recovers, market participants have been closely monitoring Fed officials' comments to determine when the central bank might start rolling back its crisis-era policies. \n\n        The Fed has signaled the first course of action would involve easing its asset purchase program, which is currently taking place at a pace of $120 billion per month. The Fed has said it is looking for 'substantial further progress' toward its goals of reaching maximum employment and price stability before beginning this roll-back, leaving investors to contemplate what degree of economic improvement might fulfill this prerequisite. Though the U.S. economy has made strides in recovering, the labor market remains more than 7 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. And core producer and consumer prices have surged over last year, albeit at elevated levels that will likely not be sustained over the coming months. \n\n        'Tapering is going to happen over the next few months; the only questions are when, and at what pace,' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Economics, wrote in a note Monday morning. 'A month or two either side of the year-end, or a few billion faster or slower tapering, won't make much difference to how the economy performs over the next couple years.'\n\n        'The obsession with tapering is a distraction from the real issue, which is whether increased underlying inflation pressure means that the Fed will have to begin raising rates sooner than it currently expects, which is at some point after 2023,' he added.\n\n        Meanwhile, as traders await a definitive start to taper talk from the Fed, a number of strategists said they expect similar areas of the market that have outperformed so far this year to continue to do so. With the economy still on the upswing coming out of the pandemic and inflation poised to hold at a level higher than years' past for at least some time, cyclical and value stocks most levered to an economic reopening could remain areas of strength, some said. \n\n        'I don't think we've seen the exhaustion of that value-cyclical trade. Certainly, we would expect that we're going to see moderation and growth here in the second half of this year from the very heady pace of growth we've had over the last couple of quarters,' Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Yahoo Finance. 'However, I still think we're going to see well above-trend economic activity, as a consequence of the more uniform reopening of the services industries ... lead to some emergence of inflation that is likely to percolate at an above-trend level over that which we've seen in the last decade or so.' \n\n        \u2014\n        4:02 p.m. ET: Stocks end mixed as traders look ahead to Fed decision; Technology shares outperform\n\n        Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:02 p.m. ET:\n\n            S&P 500 (^GSPC): +7.74 (+0.18%) to 4,255.18\n\n            Dow (^DJI): -85.39 (-0.25%) to 34,394.21\n\n            Nasdaq (^IXIC): +104.72 (+0.74%) to 14,174.14\n\n            Crude (CL=F): +$0.11 (+0.16%) to $71.02 a barrel\n\n            Gold (GC=F): -$12.10 (-0.64%) to $1,867.50 per ounce\n\n            10-year Treasury (^TNX): +3.9 bps to yield 1.5010%\n\n        \u2014\n        1:05 p.m. ET: Dow trades at session lows \n\n        The three major indexes were mixed Monday afternoon, with technology stocks outperforming even as Treasury yields advanced and the 10-year yield broke back to 1.5%. The Nasdaq was the only major index in the green. \n\n        The Dow shed more than 260 points, or 0.8%, at its lowest point in the session Monday afternoon. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Caterpillar and Cisco dragged on the index, while Salesforce and Apple outperformed. The information technology and communication services sectors led in the S&P 500, though sharper declines in materials, financials and industrials kept the index in negative territory.  \n\n        \u2014\n        9:45 a.m. ET: 'Bet heavily on every inflation trade' if Fed keeps looking past high prices, hedge fund manager tells CNBC \n\n        Paul Tudor Jones, billionaire founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment Corporation, said investors should lean into asset classes that tend to benefit from higher-inflation environments if the Federal Reserve continues to ignore rising prices and leave monetary policy unchanged, according to an interview with CNBC on Monday.\n\n        'If they treat these numbers \u2014 which were material events, they were very material \u2014 if they treat them with nonchalance, I think it\u2019s just a green light to bet heavily on every inflation trade,\u201d Jones told CNBC's Squawk Box. Jones added he would 'probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold' in this environment. \n\n        Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rallied 13% to top $40,700 following the remarks, as well as after commentary from Tesla CEO Elon Musk that the electric car-maker might resume accepting the cryptocurrency as payment again in the future. Gold (GC=F) extended earlier losses and fell 1.5% to about $1,850 per ounce.\n\n        In April, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 3.1% over last year, coming in at an almost three-decade high. The Federal Reserve has maintained that these recent inflationary pressures will prove transitory and moderate once the economy laps last year's pandemic-depressed levels. \n\n        \u2014\n        9:30 a.m. ET: Stocks struggle for direction at the open \n\n        Here's where markets were trading shortly after the opening bell Monday morning: \n\n            S&P 500 (^GSPC): -1.5 points (-0.04%) to 4,245.94\n\n            Dow (^DJI): -28.2 points (-0.08%) to 34,451.40\n\n            Nasdaq (^IXIC): -0.06 points (-0.00%) to 14,069.36\n\n            Crude (CL=F): +$0.64 (+0.9%) to $71.55 a barrel\n\n            Gold (GC=F): -$28.20 (-1.5%) to $1,851.40 per ounce\n\n            10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.8 bps to yield 1.47%\n\n        \u2014\n        7:28 a.m. ET Monday: Stock futures trade flat \n\n        Here's where markets were trading Monday morning:\n\n            S&P 500 futures (ES=F): 4,248.00, +2.25 points (+0.05%)\n\n            Dow futures (YM=F): 34,442.00, -20 points (-0.06%)\n\n            Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): 14,040.25, +46 points (+0.33%)\n\n            Crude (CL=F): +$0.40 (+0.56%) to $71.31 a barrel\n\n            Gold (GC=F): -$23.60 (-1.26%) to $1,856.00 per ounce\n\n            10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.2 bps to yield 1.464%\n        ",

The city\u2019s security chief, John Lee, warned other journalists on Thursday to \u201cdistance\u201d themselves from the accused, who he referred to as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cperpetrators\u201d of a conspiracy.\n\n        Lee would neither specify the offending articles or explain how the national security law applied to media \u2013 a long running concern since its introduction almost one year ago. Fears now are that any prosecution of the five executives will further strengthen a chilling effect across the industry.\n\n        The police operation was condemned by foreign governments including the US, UK, Australia and the EU, rights organisations and journalism groups. Beijing accused them of vilifying the police and interfering in internal Hong Kong affairs.\n\n        \u201cThe facts are clear and the evidence solid, and the cases have nothing to do with press freedom.\u201d\n\n        Rupert Colville, the chief UN human rights spokesperson, said the raid \u201csends a further chilling message for media freedom.\u201d\n\n        He told Reuters: \u201cWe call on Hong Kong authorities to respect their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in line with the Basic Law, in particular freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association and the right to participate in public affairs.\u201d\n        ",

'Low turnout will increase the pressure of the enemies.'\n\nKhamenei cast his ballot on Friday and called on Iranians to get to the polls.\n\nRaisi, the frontrunner, asked all Iranians to come to the polls 'to solve the problems.'\n\nVoting time was extended on Friday until at least midnight local time (3:30 p.m. ET.)\n\nAbbas Ali Kadkhodaei, spokesman for the Guardian Council, said in tweet, 'According to the coordination with the Ministry of Interior, the voting time was extended until midnight tonight.'\n\nRaisi's campaign said he had asked for an extension to voting time.\n\nAli Naderi, a member of Raisi's staff, said on Twitter that the candidate had asked for an extension because many people had not been able vote 'due to the disconnection of technical electronic voting systems.'\n\nOther candidates have pushed for an extension. Hemmati asked for an extension until 2 a.m. Saturday morning, according to a letter seen by CNN.\n\nISNA, a state run media outlet, reported that presidential candidate Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi had also asked for an extension until 2 a.m.\n\nRaisi emerged as the frontrunner after an election supervisory body known as the Guardian Council barred his main rivals from the race. The move was widely criticized, even by Khamenei, who called some of the disqualifications 'unjust.'\n\nRaisi's expected win would come at a pivotal moment for Iran. The next government will have to confront an economic crisis exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and calls for constitutional reform. Tehran is also currently locked in negotiations with the United States about how to revive the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nThere are also growing questions around the succession plans for the 81-year-old Khamenei. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, under Iran's political system it is the Supreme Leader who makes the final call on all major matters of state. Analysts said victory for Raisi in Friday's presidential election could pave the way for him to become the next Supreme Leader.\n\n'It's the right of the people to be upset and perhaps some have been upset by the current situation, but I'm asking all of the Iranian people to come to the polls to solve the problems,' Raisi tweeted after he cast his ballot on Friday.\n\n'I hope that people will feel the change soon ... I consider myself a servant for all of the people of Iran,' Raisi also said, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nRaisi is a close associate of the Supreme Leader with a brutal record on human rights who for decades has played a leading role in the prosecution of political prisoners in Iran.\n\nIn 1988, Raisi was part of a four-person death panel that oversaw the execution of up to 5,000 political prisoners, many of whom were later buried in unmarked graves, according to rights groups.\n\nRaisi has never commented on the allegations, but it's widely believed that he rarely leaves Iran for fear of retribution or international justice over the executions.\n\nA few months after Khamenei named Raisi judicial chief in 2019, the US sanctioned him for his role in the 1988 executions and for his involvement in the suppression of the 2009 anti-government Green Movement protests.\n\nActivists call for boycott\n\nPolling stations on Friday appeared to be filled largely by conservative voters, many carrying posters of Qasem Soleimani , the top Iranian military commander killed in Baghdad last year on orders from former US President Donald Trump.\n\nBut many Iranians appeared to be staying away from the polls, dismayed by what they see as a heavily engineered election designed to further entrench the power of the country's hardline clerical rulers, despite the public's calls for reforms. Over the last few days, three candidates have dropped out of the race, two of them conservatives who were apparently trying to further boost Raisi's chances.\n\nOn social media, activists called on people to boycott the vote. 'I won't be voting. I don't think it's very effective to the situation of the country,' said one 22-year-old man before the election. 'It's possible that we already know what's going to happen.'\n\n'The government themselves have already selected [the president]. This is the truth,' said one disgruntled middle-aged man. 'We are in a bad situation. We have to choose only the one they have chosen for us.'\n\nAll of the Iranians who criticized the election in interviews with CNN asked not to be named for security reasons.\n\nA mother and her children, wearing Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' uniforms, line up at a polling station on Friday.\n\nOn Friday the head of Iran's national security council, Ali Shamkhani, blamed the Trump administration for 'disheartening' Iranian voters with its so-called maximum pressure campaign on Tehran. Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and unleashed crushing sanctions on the Iranian economy.\n\nFears in the government over voter apathy appeared to spur Khamenei to make a last-minute plea to the electorate on Thursday, warning that poor turnout would play into the hands of Iran's 'enemies' and destabilize the country. Previously, Khamenei warned that blank votes would be considered a 'sin.'\n\nBut in the days leading up to the poll, election posters were sparse, campaign centers were largely empty and the mood was somber.\n\n'I don't care about elections. Who is meant to take care of us? Rouhani ... Khamenei? They're passing us from one person to another like a basketball,' said one woman before the vote who listed a litany of her economic troubles, including being unable to provide the medication needed for her sick son.\n\n'The worst thing that can happen to me because of my objections is that I'm arrested and killed,' she said. 'But that's better than watching my son die of sickness.'",

            "n3k": "Image source: Getty Images\n\nOnce you get a handle on the terminology, it may be easier to understand how cryptocurrency works.\n\nWith so much going on in the world, it's easy to wonder if cryptocurrency feels like too steep a learning curve. A lot of the confusion with crypto is most likely due to the use of words that many of us have never heard.\n\nHere, we seek to describe some of the most commonly used cryptocurrency terms. That way, if you're starting out and want a foundation upon which to build, you have a basic glossary under your belt.\n\n1. Address\n\nAn address refers to a specific destination on the network where cryptocurrency is sent. It's like a bank account that holds only cryptocurrency. Each address is used once and is intended to offer a unique, highly-secure place to hold crypto assets.\n\nEach address consists of a unique set of alphanumeric characters. Once cryptocurrency has been sent from one party to another, the recipient uses that precise set of alphanumeric characters to prove that the cryptocurrency belongs to them and to receive the transaction.\n\n2. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital payment system that allows secure peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nUnlike other payment methods (like Venmo or PayPal) that rely on traditional banking systems, Bitcoin is decentralized. What this means is that any two people located anywhere in the world can exchange digital funds. It also means that each transaction is logged on a blockchain (much like a bank ledger) and distributed across the entire network of cryptocurrency users.\n\nThis distribution protects transactions by making each one transparent. It also cuts out third parties, like banks, companies, and countries. No one controls the Bitcoin network other than the participants. And because it isn't necessary to purchase an entire Bitcoin, anyone can become part of the network by buying a fraction of a coin.\n\n3. Blockchain\n\nRather than being managed centrally (like a central bank that manages U.S. currency), cryptocurrency is managed by a global peer-to-peer network. Blockchain refers to the digital ledger used to store all cryptocurrency transactions. According to Blockgeeks, the best way to understand blockchain is to imagine a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times and sent to a network of different computers. All cryptocurrency transactions that take place are shared and continually reconciled. That means that there is no centralized database that a hacker can corrupt, and all records are public.\n\n4. Cryptocurrency\n\nThe word cryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual money. It exists solely in electronic form and cannot be carried around like dollar bills or coins. Think of it this way: 'crypto' refers to data encryption. 'currency' is a medium of exchange (like dollars, pounds, or euros). Like the typical money we're accustomed to, cryptocurrency can be exchanged for goods and services. One primary difference is that cryptocurrency is encrypted to ensure that each transaction is secure. Examples of cryptocurrency include:\n\n5. Fiat\n\nFiat currency is government backed but not backed by an asset (like gold). In the U.S., the dollars we carry are fiat currency. Their value is based solely upon our belief that the U.S. government can back them.\n\n6. Gas\n\nThe gas price is the fee you pay to make a transaction on the blockchain. It covers the cost of paying a 'miner' to search out and receive crypto on your behalf. The size of the fee is based on how quickly you want the transaction to be completed.\n\n7. Mining\n\nMining is the process used when new Bitcoins are entered into circulation. This process requires powerful computers that can solve mathematical puzzles and are able to create a new block on the blockchain. It also involves adding safety measures to protect the transaction.\n\n8. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nNo one, outside the inventor or inventors, knows who is responsible for inventing Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used to refer to the inventor.\n\n9. Wallet\n\nA crypto wallet is where all your cryptocurrency coins are stored. The purpose of a wallet is to protect your digital currency. Security is so tight that you lose all access to your cryptocurrency if you ever lose or forget your password. The entire point of cryptocurrency is security without centralization, according to Slate. The only way to provide that security is to make individual users responsible for their passwords.\n\nThere are two main types of crypto wallets -- hot and cold. A hot wallet is connected to the internet. It makes online trades convenient, but is far less secure than a cold wallet. A cold wallet is more like a safe, kept offline in a secure spot that only you can access. It's less convenient than a hot wallet when it comes time to make purchases or trades, but infinitely more secure.\n\n10. Whale\n\nThe most valuable cryptocurrency addresses are referred to as 'whales.' A whale is an investor (or group of investors) powerful enough to influence the value of a coin. Let's say a group of whales gets together and decides to sell their Bitcoin at the same time. Naturally, the value of the coins would fall immediately following the mass sell-off. The whales could then take their profits and buy up more coins at a bargain basement price. Anyone can become a whale, although whales are typically large hedge and investment funds.\n\nWhether you're interested in buying cryptocurrency now or want to learn as much as you can before speaking with your broker, knowing the lingo is a good first step.\n\nTop credit card wipes out interest\n\nIf you have credit card debt, transferring it to this top balance transfer card can allow you to pay 0% interest for a whopping 18 months! That's one reason our experts rate this card as a top pick to help get control of your debt. It'll allow you to pay 0% interest on both balance transfers and new purchases during the promotional period, and you'll pay no annual fee.
